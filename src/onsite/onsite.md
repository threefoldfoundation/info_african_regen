# On-Site & Logistics

## Transport

We would recommend taking local transport as much as possible. There are many transportation options on the island, including private van, tuk tuk (bajaj), and motorcycle taxi (boda boda). In addition, there are local buses called dala dalas, but they are a bit less convenient and harder to predict.

- Private vans can be booked through the Romany (WhatsApp: +255 772 453 183)
- For tuk tuk services, we would recommend Suleiman (WhatsApp: +255 715 791 186)
- Motorcycle taxis are typically as simple as flagging someone down on the street

As mentioned in the "Plan Your Trip" section, if you would like, we are happy to arrange airport transfer for you at a reasonable price. Please contact Romany on WhatsApp (+255772453183) and he will sort it out for you.

## Safety

The island is very safe although theft can be common, so please be mindful of where you keep your valuables and do not go out on your own at night.
