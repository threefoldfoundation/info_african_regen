# On-Site & Logistics

## Safety

The island is very safe although theft can be common, so please be mindful of where you keep your valuables and do not go out on your own at night.

## Transport

We would recommend taking local transport as much as possible. There are many transportation options on the island, including private van, tuk tuk, and motorcycle taxi. In addition, there are local busses called dala dalas, but they are a bit less convenient and harder to predict.

We will update ASAP with more information, including some trusted contacts and example prices.

If you would like, we are happy to arrange airport transfer for a small fee.
