# On-Site & Logistics

## What To Do When You Arrive at the Event

Our gathering is located at Jungle Paradise Resort & Spa, also known as Mbweni Ruins, the site of the Eden community project.

When you arrive at the entrance, please head to the check-in counter and state your name. You'll receive a bracelet which will identify you as a conference attendee, and will provide you entry over the four days.

Where you head next will depend on your time of arrival. You may go to Mbweni Ruins where the dinner on the first night and all of main sessions will be held. Or you may head through the grounds to the restaurant area.

We will be communicating via [our Telegram group](https://t.me/+U3Bc77YxDs1mZjUy), so keep your eyes peeled there for more info.

Again, please stay tuned on the group, as schedules are subject to change.

## Meals

As part of the event, we will provide dinner on Thursday at the Ruins, as well as breakfast and lunch on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. On Friday and Saturday evenings, we will be heading to nearby Stone Town, where you can find a variety of options for meals. As well on Sunday we are planning to have some food at our closing event.

## Transport

We would recommend taking local transport as much as possible. There are many transportation options on the island, including private van, tuk tuk (bajaj), and motorcycle taxi (boda boda). In addition, there are local buses called dala dalas, but they are a bit less convenient and harder to predict.

- Private vans can be booked through the Romany (WhatsApp: +255 772 453 183)
- For tuk tuk services, we would recommend Suleiman (WhatsApp: +255 715 791 186)
- Motorcycle taxis are typically as simple as flagging someone down on the street

As mentioned in the "Plan Your Trip" section, if you would like, we are happy to arrange airport transfer for you at a reasonable price. Please contact Romany on WhatsApp (+255 772 453 183) and he will sort it out for you.

## Safety

The island is very safe although theft can be common, so please be mindful of where you keep your valuables and do not go out on your own at night.
