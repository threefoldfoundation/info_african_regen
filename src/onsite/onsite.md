# On-Site & Logistics

## What To Do When You Arrive at the Event

Our gathering is located at Jungle Paradise Resort & Spa, also known as Mbweni Ruins.

When you arrive at the entrance, please head to the check-in counter and state your name. You'll receive a bracelet which will identify you as a conference attendee, and will provide you entry over the four days.

Where you head next will depend on your time of arrival.

We will be communicating via [our Telegram group](https://t.me/+U3Bc77YxDs1mZjUy), so keep your eyes peeled there for more info.

Again, please stay tuned on the group, as schedules are subject to change.

## Food & Beverage

As part of the event, we will provide some meals.

Any food ordered separately or off the menu will be added to a tab and we ask you to cover that cost.

For beverages, we will provide water dispensers during the event for you to take for your own personal water bottles. Any other beverages (outside of a few "happy hours" which will be made clear) including bottled water, coffee, juices, soft drinks, and alcohol, would be at your cost.

Please pay your bill before you depart the event.

If you feel so inclined, you are welcomed to give tips to the staff. You can find the tip box at the restaurant cash register.

*Outside restaurants (and street food) are generally safe and up to sanitary standards, but please assess for yourself.*

## Transport

We would recommend taking local transport as much as possible. There are many transportation options on the island, including private van, tuk tuk (bajaj), and motorcycle taxi (boda boda). In addition, there are local buses called dala dalas, but they are a bit less convenient and harder to predict.

- Private vans can be booked through the Romany (WhatsApp: +255 772 453 183)
- For tuk tuk services, we would recommend Suleiman (WhatsApp: +255 715 791 186)
- Motorcycle taxis are typically as simple as flagging someone down on the street

As mentioned in the "Plan Your Trip" section, if you would like, we are happy to arrange airport transfer for you at a reasonable price. Please contact Romany on WhatsApp (+255 772 453 183) and he will sort it out for you.

## Spa Services

There is a spa on-site offering a variety of services. If interested, please contact the front desk.

## Safety

The island is very safe although theft can be common, so please be mindful of where you keep your valuables and do not go out on your own at night.
