# Plan Your Trip

- Zanzibar Abeid Amani Karume International Airport (ZNZ) is just 10 minutes from our location
- You can find direct international flights from Istanbul, Dubai, Doha, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Zurich, and Rome (note: not every day for all departure points)
- We would recommend to arrive at least one day before the conference and leave the day after to enjoy the full experience
