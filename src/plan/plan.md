# Visas and Other Information

- Many countries require a Visa to enter Zanzibar and Tanzania as a whole.
- Please take a look at [these guidelines](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/guidelines), specifically the list of countries who require referral visa as well as countries which do not require a visa.
- For all others, you can [apply for a Visa online](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/) but also keep in mind you may also obtain a Visa on Arrival, which is quite simple and typically our recommendation.
- You can simply apply for / fill out the form for an Ordinary Visa (or Multiple Entry visa for Americans), which satisfies entry for visit, tourism, attending a conference, etc. Most countries receive a single-entry visa ($50 USD) while Americans are required to take a 12-month multiple entry visa for $100 USD.

- It is technically required to have a return ticket or proof of onward travel when entering Tanzania, and in some cases your airline will ask you for this before boarding. If you are unsure of your return date, we would recommend taking a flexible ticket.
