# Welcome | Karibu

Spawned by Zuzalu, a pop-up city by Vitalik Buterin in Montenegro, the crypto/web3 community, venture capitalists & technologists and city builders, this event aims to bring together current and future leaders that are working to make Africa a hub for technology, innovation and regeneration.

This resource is meant to be an evolving guide for the event in July. If you have things you'd like to add, please [get in touch with Sam](https://t.me/samtaggart).
