# Accommodation

- We have very limited spaces at the Jungle Paradise Hotel as well as some apartments which are located directly at the event venue – **if you’d like one of those spots, please [get in touch with Sam](https://t.me/samtaggart) ASAP.
- If you would like to book your own accommodation, we would recommend looking at places in either Mbweni or nearby Stone Town (15 minutes from the event) which is the main “city” on the island and also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
