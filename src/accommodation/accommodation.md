# Accommodation

- We have limited spaces at the hotel as well as some apartments which are located directly at the event venue – **if you’d like one of those spots, please fill out [this questionnaire](https://forms.gle/a4n4iXG1xqK4j5Bj9) before the end of June**.
- If you would like to book your own accommodation, we would recommend looking at places in either Mbweni or nearby Stone Town (15 minutes from the event) which is the main “city” on the island and also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
